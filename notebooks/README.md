# Notebooks

- `01_labeling.ipynb` – template for visualizing IMU traces, tagging serve quality, and exporting CSV labels.
- `02_feature_sweep.ipynb` – compare classical features (FFT, jerk, quaternion integration).
- `03_qat.ipynb` – quantization-aware training workflow prior to deploying to firmware.

Create these notebooks via Jupyter/Colab as you iterate; this README simply documents the intended flow.
